## 🎯 Overview

The Juakali Marketplace addresses a critical gap in access, visibility, and digital organization within the informal sector by leveraging modern web technologies. The platform enables service seekers to discover, compare, and book trusted local service providers while giving artisans a digital platform to showcase their services, manage bookings, and expand their client base.

### Problem Statement

The informal sector (Juakali sector) has high skill levels but low system organization. Current service interactions are handled informally through unstructured and unreliable communication methods, leading to:

- **Lack of visibility**: Service providers struggle to reach a larger consumer base
- **Inefficient bookings**: Customers face difficulty identifying, comparing, and booking artisans
- **No service records**: Absence of tracking, reviews, or accountability mechanisms
- **Limited scalability**: Reliance on word-of-mouth and local relationships

### Solution

The Juakali Marketplace provides a centralized platform where:
- Service providers can list services, manage bookings, and track statistics
- Service seekers can search, filter, and book services efficiently
- Both parties benefit from structured interactions and booking workflows
- Category management helps organize services by type

## 🚀 Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.10+** (for backend)
- **Node.js 18+** and **npm** (for frontend)
- **Firebase Project** (for authentication)
- **Git** (for version control)

## 🪟 Windows Setup Guide

If you're setting this up on a Windows computer, follow these steps carefully. I'll walk you through everything you need to get the project running on your machine.

### Before You Start

You'll need to have these programs installed on your computer:
- Python (version 3.10 or newer)
- Node.js (includes npm automatically)
- Git (optional, but helpful)

### Installing Python on Windows

1. **Download Python:**
   - Open your web browser and go to: https://www.python.org/downloads/
   - Click the big yellow "Download Python" button
   - The website will automatically detect you're on Windows and give you the right version

2. **Install Python:**
   - Run the downloaded installer (it will be named something like `python-3.12.x.exe`)
   - **Important:** On the first screen, check the box that says "Add Python to PATH" - this is crucial!
   - Click "Install Now"
   - Wait for the installation to finish

3. **Verify Python is installed:**
   - Press the Windows key and type "cmd" to open Command Prompt
   - Type this and press Enter:
     ```
     python --version
     ```
   - You should see something like "Python 3.12.x" - if you see an error, Python might not be added to your PATH

### Installing Node.js on Windows

1. **Download Node.js:**
   - Go to: https://nodejs.org/
   - You'll see two buttons - click the green one that says "LTS" (Long Term Support)
   - This downloads the installer

2. **Install Node.js:**
   - Run the installer you just downloaded
   - Just click "Next" through all the screens - the default options are fine
   - At the end, it will install everything automatically
   - You might need to restart your computer after this

3. **Verify Node.js is installed:**
   - Open Command Prompt again (close and reopen it after installing)
   - Type:
     ```
     node --version
     ```
   - You should see a version number like "v20.x.x"
   - Also check npm:
     ```
     npm --version
     ```
   - You should see another version number

### Installing Git on Windows (Optional)

If you don't have Git installed:

1. Go to: https://git-scm.com/download/win
2. Download the installer and run it
3. Click "Next" through all the screens - defaults are fine
4. This lets you use `git clone` commands

### Getting the Project Files

You can either:
- Download the project as a ZIP file and extract it, OR
- Use Git to clone it (if you installed Git)

**If using ZIP:**
- Extract the folder to somewhere easy to find, like your Desktop or Documents folder
- Remember where you put it!

**If using Git:**
- Open Command Prompt
- Navigate to where you want the project:
  ```
  cd Desktop
  ```
- Clone the repository (you'll need the repository URL)

### Setting Up the Backend

1. **Open Command Prompt:**
   - Press Windows key, type "cmd", press Enter

2. **Navigate to the backend folder:**
   - First, go to where your project is. For example:
     ```
     cd Desktop
     cd "JUAKALI MARKETPLACE"
     cd backend
     ```
   - Tip: If you're not sure where you are, type `cd` and then drag the folder from File Explorer into the Command Prompt window - it will paste the path automatically

3. **Create a Virtual Environment:**
   - This creates a special folder that keeps this project's Python packages separate from other projects
   - Type:
     ```
     python -m venv django_venv
     ```
   - Wait for it to finish - you'll see your prompt come back

4. **Activate the Virtual Environment:**
   - Every time you work on the backend, you need to activate this first
   - Type:
     ```
     django_venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - You should now see `(django_venv)` at the start of your command line - this means it's working!

5. **Install the Required Packages:**
   - Type:
     ```
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```
   - This downloads all the Python libraries the project needs
   - It might take a few minutes - just wait until it's done
   - Don't worry if you see some warnings in yellow - that's normal

6. **Set Up the Database:**
   - Type:
     ```
     python manage.py migrate
     ```
   - This creates all the database tables the app needs
   - You should see a list of migrations being applied

### Setting Up Firebase

Firebase is what handles user login and registration. You need to set this up before the app will work.

#### Creating a Firebase Project

1. Go to: https://console.firebase.google.com/
2. Sign in with your Google account
3. Click "Add Project" or "Create a Project"
4. Give it a name (like "Juakali Marketplace")
5. Click through the setup screens - you can disable Google Analytics if you want
6. Click "Create Project" and wait for it to finish

#### Getting Your Firebase Configuration

1. In Firebase Console, click the gear icon (⚙️) next to "Project Overview"
2. Click "Project Settings"
3. Scroll down to the "Your apps" section
4. Click the web icon (looks like `</>`)
5. Give your app a nickname (like "Juakali Web")
6. Click "Register app"
7. You'll see a code block with your configuration - **copy these values!** They look like:
   ```
   apiKey: "AIzaSy..."
   authDomain: "your-project.firebaseapp.com"
   projectId: "your-project-id"
   storageBucket: "your-project.appspot.com"
   messagingSenderId: "123456789"
   appId: "1:123456789:web:abcdef"
   ```

#### Setting Up Backend Firebase

1. Still in Firebase Console, go to "Project Settings" → "Service Accounts" tab
2. Click "Generate New Private Key"
3. Click "Generate Key" in the popup
4. A JSON file will download - this is your service account key
5. Rename this file to: `firebase-service-account.json`
6. Move it to the `backend/core/` folder
   - You can do this by opening File Explorer, going to your project, then `backend/core/`
   - Just drag and drop the file there

#### Setting Up Frontend Firebase

1. Open File Explorer and navigate to your project's `frontend` folder
2. In the `frontend` folder, create a new file called `.env`
   - Right-click → New → Text Document
   - Name it exactly `.env` (including the dot at the start)
   - If Windows warns you about changing the extension, click "Yes"
3. Open `.env` in Notepad
4. Paste this, replacing the values with what you copied from Firebase:
   ```
   VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=paste_your_api_key_here
   VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your-project.firebaseapp.com
   VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
   VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your-project.appspot.com
   VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=123456789
   VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID=1:123456789:web:abcdef
   ```
5. Save the file (Ctrl+S)

#### Enabling Email/Password Login

1. In Firebase Console, click "Authentication" in the left menu
2. Click "Get Started"
3. Click "Email/Password" from the list
4. Toggle the "Enable" switch to ON
5. Click "Save"

### Setting Up the Frontend

1. **Open a New Command Prompt Window:**
   - Keep your backend window open, but open a second Command Prompt for the frontend

2. **Navigate to the Frontend Folder:**
   ```
   cd Desktop
   cd "JUAKALI MARKETPLACE"
   cd frontend
   ```

3. **Install Node Packages:**
   ```
   npm install
   ```
   - This downloads all the JavaScript libraries the project needs
   - It might take a few minutes - you'll see lots of text scrolling
   - Wait until you see your prompt again (no errors)

### Running the Project

You need to run both the backend and frontend at the same time, so you'll need two Command Prompt windows.

#### Starting the Backend Server

1. In your first Command Prompt window (the one in the `backend` folder)
2. Make sure you see `(django_venv)` at the start - if not, activate it:
   ```
   django_venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
3. Start the server:
   ```
   python manage.py runserver
   ```
4. You should see:
   ```
   Starting development server at http://127.0.0.1:8000/
   ```
5. **Leave this window open!** The server needs to keep running

#### Starting the Frontend Server

1. In your second Command Prompt window (the one in the `frontend` folder)
2. Start the development server:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```
3. Wait a moment - you'll see:
   ```
   VITE v7.1.7  ready in 500 ms
   ➜  Local:   http://localhost:5173/
   ```
4. **Leave this window open too!** The frontend server also needs to keep running

#### Opening the Application

1. Open your web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, or any browser)
2. Go to: `http://localhost:5173`
3. You should see the Juakali Marketplace homepage!

### Common Issues and Fixes

**"python is not recognized" or "python: command not found"**
- Python might not be installed correctly, or it's not in your PATH
- Try using `py` instead of `python` (Windows Python Launcher)
- Or reinstall Python and make absolutely sure to check "Add Python to PATH"

**"npm is not recognized"**
- Node.js might not be installed, or you need to restart your computer
- Close and reopen Command Prompt
- If that doesn't work, reinstall Node.js

**"Port 8000 already in use" or "Port 5173 already in use"**
- Another program is using that port number
- For backend, you can use a different port:
  ```
  python manage.py runserver 8001
  ```
- For frontend, it will usually suggest an alternate port automatically

**Virtual environment won't activate**
- Make sure you're in the `backend` folder first
- Try typing the full path:
  ```
  .\django_venv\Scripts\activate
  ```
- If you're using PowerShell, you might need to run this first:
  ```
  Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
  ```
  Then try activating again

**Can't find my `.env` file**
- Make sure it's named exactly `.env` (with the dot)
- Windows might hide files starting with dots - in File Explorer, go to View → Show → Hidden items
- Make sure it's in the `frontend` folder, not `backend`

**Firebase errors when trying to login**
- Double-check your `.env` file has the correct values
- Make sure there are no spaces around the `=` signs
- Make sure the file is saved
- Restart the frontend server after changing the `.env` file (close it with Ctrl+C and run `npm run dev` again)

**"Module not found" errors**
- You might not have installed all the packages
- For backend: Make sure the virtual environment is activated, then run `pip install -r requirements.txt` again
- For frontend: Run `npm install` again in the frontend folder

**Can't find the project folder in Command Prompt**
- Open File Explorer and navigate to your project folder
- Click in the address bar at the top and copy the path
- In Command Prompt, type `cd` followed by pasting the path:
  ```
  cd C:\Users\YourName\Desktop\JUAKALI MARKETPLACE
  ```

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SingasonSimon/JUAKALI-MARKETPLACE.git
cd "JUAKALI MARKETPLACE"
```

### Step 2: Backend Setup

```bash
# Navigate to backend directory
cd backend

# Create virtual environment (recommended)
python3 -m venv django_venv

# Activate virtual environment
# On Linux/Mac:
source django_venv/bin/activate
# On Windows:
django_venv\Scripts\activate

# Install Python dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run database migrations
python manage.py migrate

# (Optional) Create Django superuser for admin panel
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

### Step 3: Frontend Setup

```bash
# Navigate to frontend directory
cd frontend

# Install Node.js dependencies
npm install
```

```

## 📊 System Architecture

### Three-Tier Architecture

```
┌─────────────────┐
│   React Frontend │  ← Presentation Layer
│   (Vite + React) │
└────────┬─────────┘
         │ HTTP/REST API
┌────────▼─────────┐
│ Django REST API  │  ← Application Layer
│   (Django 5.2.7) │
└────────┬─────────┘
         │ ORM
┌────────▼─────────┐
│   SQLite/PostgreSQL│  ← Data Layer
│   (via Django ORM)│
└──────────────────┘
```

### Authentication Flow

1. User registers/logs in via Firebase Authentication
2. Firebase returns ID token
3. Frontend stores token and includes it in API requests
4. Django backend verifies token using Firebase Admin SDK
5. Backend links Firebase user to Django CustomUser model
6. Role-based permissions are enforced on API endpoints
